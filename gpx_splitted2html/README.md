# gpx_splitted2html
A set of three scripts that splits a GPX file by an assigned time breaks and convert them simplified and compact HTML page, easy to print

1. **gpx_split.py** (Copyright (C) 2015 Harvey Chapman [Harvey Chapman](mailto:hchapman@3gfp.com)) - splits a GPX with time breaks set to 10 minutes, in a folder that has the same name of that file;
2. **gpx_folder_viewer.py** - giving a folder full of splitted GPX files, it creates an HTML with all the tracks and summary. This file can be printed in A4 format.
3. **gpx_file_viewer.py** - from a GPX file it returns an HTML with the map of the track and the summary.
