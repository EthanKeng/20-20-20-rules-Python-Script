This repo is forked from @rainnic and used to be a bunch of python scripts. I deleted all other scripts and only remain "eye_strain_reducer". Also, I modified some lines to let it run on Windows system (originally only Linux OS can run).  

# eye_strain_reducer 
- eye_strain_reducer (a little program to respect the 20-20-20 rule and prevent eye strain)
